== Changelog ==

= 1.4.5 =
* Fixed an issue that was appearing when the course categories where not set for a membership level.
* Added the "Show course lecturer on the payment page" checkbox to the "General" tab in Educator > Settings.
* Code cleanup, improvements, and fixes.

= 1.4.4 =
* IMPORTANT UPDATE: added a fix in response to the taxonomy term splitting since WordPress 4.2. Since WP 4.2, when you update a term (e.g., a "Course Category") and if it is shared between multiple taxonomies, a new term is created which replaces the current term and has a different term_id. Educator stores term_id's for memberships (Educator > Membership Levels > Membership Settings > Categories) to give members ability to join courses from specified categories. If the term gets split, it's new term_id won't correspond to the old one that is stored in a membership. Educator 1.4.4 addresses this issue.
* Please read this article carefully: <a href="http://educatorplugin.com/term-taxonomy-splitting-in-wp-4-2-and-how-it-affects-educator/">Term Taxonomy Splitting in WP 4.2 and How It Affects Educator</a>. You might need to update "categories" attribute in the Educator's [courses] shortcode (when you edit categories in Courses > Course Categories), if you use this shortcode somewhere.

= 1.4.3 =
* Added ability to enable comments on lessons.
  - The visibility of the lesson comments on the single lesson page depens on the lesson's "Access" option.
  - Lesson comments are removed from the general comments feed (e.g., example.com/?feed=comments-rss2).
* Other improvements and fixes.

= 1.4.2 =
* Fixed an issue when the plugin didn't load translation (.MO) file from the "languages" directory. It loaded the MO file from "wp-content/languages/plugins" directory.

= 1.4.1 =
* Improved UI for the following admin screens: edit payment, edit entry, edit member.
* Added "Access" option to lessons. This option allows to make a lesson's content viewable without course registration.
* Added ability to open/close registration for a given course (the "Registration" option in the course edit screen).
* Other improvements and fixes.

= 1.4.0 =
* Refactored the payment system. Now, developers can create custom payment gateways.
* Added the taxes feature. Because it is a new feature, please test it carefully before using.
  - Added the "Taxes" tab to the settings page.
  - Enable/disable taxes.
  - Enter prices inclusive of taxes or exclusive.
  - Manage tax rates.
* Added new settings to the Educator > Settings, General.
  - Location.
  - Store customers' IPs on purchases.
* Added billing info on the payment page if taxes are enabled.

* The flush_rewrite_rules function is not called on every plugin update anymore. It's called on plugin activation/deactivation only.
* Improvements to the get_access_status method from IB_Educator class. If entry is pending and payment is pending, the status should be "pending_entry".
* Modified "ib_educator_register_form" action hook. Now, it receives WP_Error object instead of an array of error codes as the first argument.
* Code refactoring.

= 1.3.5 =
* Added the beta version of the Stripe payment gateway. It's a beta version, so please test it before using it on production.
* Lecturers can see which entries have the quizzes that are ready to be graded. The text "quiz pending" is added to the entry row on the Entries admin page.
* Added the "ib_educator_access_status" filter.

= 1.3.4 =
* Improved the lesson content restriction even further.
* Added a filter to the "rss_use_excerpt" option (the setting "For each article in a feed, show" in Settings &raquo; Reading) such that it returns 1 for lessons.
* The lesson content should be empty in the feeds by default (no excerpt should show up in there).

= 1.3.3 =
* IMPORTANT security fix. This update fixes the issue where the lesson content was visible to unregistered visitors in the lessons rss/atom feed, the lessons archive and the search page. On the lessons archive and the search page it was visible only when the lesson didn't have the "more" tag (&lt;!--more--&gt;).
* Please make sure to update the lessons' excerpts and add the more tag in appropriate places (please read http://educatorplugin.com/create-a-lesson/).
* Please apply this update as soon as possible.
