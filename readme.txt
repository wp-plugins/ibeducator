== Changelog ==

= 1.3.4 =
* Improved the lesson content restriction even further.
* Added a filter to the "rss_use_excerpt" option (the setting "For each article in a feed, show" in Settings &raquo; Reading) such that it returns 1 for lessons.
* The lesson content should be empty in the feeds by default (no excerpt should show up in there).

= 1.3.3 =
* IMPORTANT security fix. This update fixes the issue where the lesson content was visible to unregistered visitors in the lessons rss/atom feed, the lessons archive and the search page. On the lessons archive and the search page it was visible only when the lesson didn't have the "more" tag (&lt;!--more--&gt;).
* Please make sure to update the lessons' excerpts and add the more tag in appropriate places (please read http://incrediblebytes.com/educator-wp-plugin-might-need-update-lessons/).
* Please apply this update as soon as possible.

  - lecturer adds grade to his/her quiz.
* Edit email notifications in Educator &raquo; Settings &raquo; Emails
* Administrator can add payments and entries manually.
* Autocomplete for the 'Course' and 'Student' fields in "Edit Payment" and "Edit Entry" forms.
* Namespaced settings_errors() on settings pages to prevent non-relevant errors from showing up.
